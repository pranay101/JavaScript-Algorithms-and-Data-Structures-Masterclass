// OBJECTIVES
// Define what a binary heap is
// Compare and contrast min and max heaps
// Implement basic methods on heaps
// Understand where heaps are used in the real world and what other data structures can 
// be constructed from heaps.


// WHAT IS A BINARY HEAP?
// Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!
// In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. 
// In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
